# NavigatorSmokeTests
This project is an automated smoke test for a website navigator.ba. I have received the task from a company Atlantbh. The project basically tests the core functions of the mentioned website – adding a new place, searching a place via search bar, and commenting some already added place. 

I have written the following test cases:
•	createNewPlaceAndSearchTest – I have written this test for creating a new place and searching the same place through the search bar. With this I have tested the creation of the place and the search bar.

•	editPlaceTest – This test is for editing already created place. I have tried editing just the required fields.

•	claimPlaceTest – This test is for the option the website has for claiming the place. I have tested entering all the data. 

Scripting language is Java. I have used the following tools:

•	IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2021.3.1. - https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows
